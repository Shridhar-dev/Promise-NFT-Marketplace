# Promise NFT Marketplace

This project uses the power of NFT's(Non-Fungible Tokens) to make the process of making promises better, transparent and secure. It provides proof for all the promises made, along with a system of approval and rejection. The project has many use-cases ranging from making legit promises like helping, returning,etc to things like selling one's time(e.g having a talk for an hour)

The smart contracts are deployed on the rinkeby test network
